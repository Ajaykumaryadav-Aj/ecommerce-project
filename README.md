# eCommerce Project

Welcome to my eCommerce project! This project allows users to browse products, filter them, add them to the cart, manage the wishlist, and place an order. It uses **localStorage** for saving cart and wishlist data.

## Features

1. **Product Filter**: 
   - Users can filter products by category (Men's, Women's, Kids, etc.) to find products quickly.

2. **Add to Cart**: 
   - Users can add products to the cart with a single click. The cart is saved in the browser's **localStorage**, so the items remain even after the page reloads.

3. **Add to Wishlist**: 
   - Users can add products to the wishlist for future reference. Like the cart, wishlist is saved in **localStorage**.

4. **Order Summary**: 
   - After adding items to the cart, users can view a summary of their selected products, along with the total price and other details.

5. **Place Order**: 
   - Once the user is satisfied with their cart, they can proceed to place an order. This functionality is connected to the order summary page.

6. **localStorage**: 
   - Both the **Cart** and **Wishlist** are saved in **localStorage**, which means the data persists even after the browser is closed or the page is refreshed.
